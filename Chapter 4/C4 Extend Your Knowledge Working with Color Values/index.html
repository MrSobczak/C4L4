               <!-- Use the paragraph element below to compare and contrast your findings regarding hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes. -->
                <p>HSL, or Hue, Saturation, Lightness is better than RGB and HEX because the color doesn't change completely, just the lightness or saturation. HEX and RGB are arbitrary values for each color. </p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify your preferred color code format (hexadecimal, RBG, or HSL) and why. -->
                <p>Preferred color code format: HSL, or Hue, Saturation, Lightness is better than RGB and HEX because the color doesn't change completely, just the lightness or saturation. </p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss HWB color. -->
                <p>HWB summary HWB is a cylindrical-coordinate representation of points in an RGB color model, similar to HSL and HSV. HWB was designed to be more intuitive for humans to use[1] and slightly faster to compute. The first coordinate, H (Hue), is the same as the Hue coordinate in HSL and HSV. W and B stand for Whiteness and Blackness respectively and range from 0–100% (or 0–1). The mental model is that the user can pick a main hue and then “mix” it with white and/or black to produce the desired color.</p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss CMYK color. -->
                <p>CMYK summary The CMYK color model (also known as process color, or four color) is a subtractive color model, based on the CMY color model, used in color printing, and is also used to describe the printing process itself. CMYK refers to the four ink plates used in some color printing: cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black).</p>
